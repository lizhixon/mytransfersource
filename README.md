Print previewer for My Transfer Source t-shirts

My Transfer Source is a company that prints and ships t-shirt transfers.
For the sublimation dye method, the image printed will essentially be multiplied on the t-shirt.
This previewer allows people to simulate how the final image will look by:
1) choosing their t-shirt color
2) uploading their artwork
3) selecting the cotton/poly blend percentage

Once they're satisfied with their artwork, they can click to redirect them on the site to go ahead and upload their files for printing.
